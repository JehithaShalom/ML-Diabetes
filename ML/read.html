# Diabetes Patient Analysis with Machine Learning using BeautifulSoup

This project combines Machine Learning techniques with web scraping using BeautifulSoup, a Python library, to extract information relevant to diabetes patients from online sources. The extracted data is then utilized to train models for analysis, prediction, and insights related to diabetes patients.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to collect data from various online platforms such as medical websites, forums, and journals using web scraping techniques. BeautifulSoup is employed to parse HTML and extract structured data efficiently. The extracted data includes patient demographics, medical history, symptoms, treatments, and outcomes related to diabetes.

Once the data is gathered, it undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and formatting inconsistencies. Features are engineered to extract meaningful insights, and the data is split into training and testing sets for machine learning model training.

The trained models can be utilized for several purposes, including:

- Predicting the risk of diabetes in patients based on their attributes.
- Analyzing trends and patterns in diabetes prevalence and treatment effectiveness.
- Recommending personalized treatment plans based on patient profiles and medical history.

## Installation

Anaconda3-64:
	After installating anaconda3,then install the python libary in and using the database we can easy find the train,test data and accuracy
